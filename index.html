<!--
This is a poem
about coding.
There is a problem:
Xcode does not allow
for extra scrolling.

How, then, you ask,
is it possible
to scroll
past the limits
of the code?

The answer
is simple.
Either add
line breaks
or a poem,
whitespace
or words.

I have chosen
the latter.
You can probably
tell
because this
is not
whitespace.

It is a poem
(which is,
in this case,
just a set of
sentences
with some line breaks
in between).

How would this poem look
without line breaks?
